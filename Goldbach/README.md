# Explanation of the Provided C++ Code

The provided C++ code includes a main function and two additional functions, `Goldbach` and `Goldbach2`, that are used to verify Goldbach's conjecture for a given even integer \( n \). Goldbach's conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

## Main Function

1. **User Input:** The main function prompts the user to enter an integer \( n \).
2. **Execution Time Measurement:** It measures the execution time of the `Goldbach` function.
3. **Function Call:** It calls the `Goldbach` function with the user input \( n \) and attempts to find two prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( p + q = n \).
4. **Output:** It prints the execution time and the values of \( p \) and \( q \).
5. **Error Handling:** If the function throws an error (e.g., if \( n \) is odd or less than or equal to 2), the main function catches and prints the error message.

## Goldbach Function

The `Goldbach` function attempts to find two prime numbers whose sum is equal to the given even integer \( n \).

1. **Input Validation:** It checks if \( n \) is odd or less than or equal to 2. If so, it throws an error.
2. **Special Case for 4:** If \( n \) is 4, it sets \( p \) and \( q \) to 2.
3. **Prime Number Generation:** It generates a list of prime numbers less than \( n \) using a simple primality test.
4. **Finding Pairs:** It iterates through the list of prime numbers to find a pair whose sum equals \( n \). If such a pair is found, it sets \( p \) and \( q \) to these prime numbers.
5. **Hypothesis Verification:** If no such pair is found, it throws an error indicating that the hypothesis does not hold.

## Goldbach2 Function

The `Goldbach2` function provides an alternative approach to verify Goldbach's conjecture.

1. **Input Validation:** Similar to the `Goldbach` function, it checks if \( n \) is odd or less than or equal to 2, throwing an error if either condition is met.
2. **Special Case for 4:** It handles the special case for \( n = 4 \) by setting \( p \) and \( q \) to 2.
3. **Finding Pairs:** It iterates through possible pairs of prime numbers such that their sum equals \( n \). For each potential pair, it performs a primality test to ensure both numbers are prime.
4. **Output:** If a valid pair is found, it sets \( p \) and \( q \) to these prime numbers and returns. If no such pair is found, it throws an error indicating that the hypothesis does not hold.
