# Explanation of the Provided C++ Code

The provided C++ code includes two classes, `NizLista` and `JednostrukaLista`, which are implementations of a list data structure. The code also contains a main function to demonstrate the usage of these list classes.

## Lista Class
This is an abstract base class (template) that defines a list interface with the following virtual methods:
- `brojElemenata() const`: Returns the number of elements in the list.
- `trenutni()`: Returns the current element in the list.
- `trenutni() const`: Returns the current element in the list (const version).
- `prethodni()`: Moves the current position to the previous element.
- `sljedeci()`: Moves the current position to the next element.
- `pocetak()`: Sets the current position to the start of the list.
- `kraj()`: Sets the current position to the end of the list.
- `obrisi()`: Deletes the current element from the list.
- `dodajIspred(const tip&)`: Adds an element before the current element.
- `dodajIza(const tip&)`: Adds an element after the current element.
- `operator[](int)`: Accesses the element at the given index.
- `operator[](int) const`: Accesses the element at the given index (const version).

## NizLista Class
This class implements the `Lista` interface using a dynamic array.
- It includes methods to add elements, delete elements, and navigate through the list.
- The list is maintained as an array of a fixed size (`vel`), with the ability to resize when needed.
- Elements can be added before or after the current position.
- Provides copy constructor and assignment operator to handle deep copies of the list.

## JednostrukaLista Class
This class implements the `Lista` interface using a singly linked list.
- It includes methods to add elements, delete elements, and navigate through the list.
- Each element in the list is stored in a node (`Cvor`) that contains the value and a pointer to the next node.
- Provides copy constructor and assignment operator to handle deep copies of the list.

## Main Function
- Demonstrates the usage of `NizLista`.
- Adds elements to the list using `dodajIspred`.
- Creates copies of the list using the copy constructor and assignment operator.
- Deletes an element from the list using `obrisi`.
- Prints the number of elements in the original and copied lists.

### Usage Example
The main function creates a `NizLista` of integers, adds elements to it, creates copies, and demonstrates element deletion and retrieval.

This code is a good example of implementing and using a custom list data structure with dynamic arrays and linked lists in C++.
